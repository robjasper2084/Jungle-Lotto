/**
 * The crash-only active ragdoll (M15).
 *
 * `docs/PLANS.md` §15's Option B, built exactly as audited: a verlet particle
 * body that exists *only while the controller is in the `crashing` state*, in
 * plain scalar math with no `three` import (invariant 1), colliding with the
 * world through the same two doors the wheel already uses — `sampleGround`
 * for the ground and the swept `raycastObstacle` for authored solids
 * (invariant 3). There is still no second *gameplay* body: nothing here feeds
 * back into speed, heading, recovery timing, scoring, or any other question
 * the referee asks. The particles are where the rider's limbs visibly are,
 * and that is the entire contract, the same one the scripted separation had.
 *
 * **Deterministic by construction.** Fixed-step verlet with a fixed iteration
 * order and no randomness: two identical crash entries produce bit-identical
 * tumbles, so a frozen `advance(n)` still reaches the same frame every run
 * and the variety players see comes from real entry state — speed, lean,
 * cause, terrain — which no two crashes genuinely share.
 *
 * **Active, not limp.** A weak pull draws the hands toward the head and the
 * feet toward the pelvis — `EUC_RIDER_MOTION_REFERENCE.md` §16's "arms
 * protect body" — and heavy damping settles the body into a held,
 * contorted-but-comic rest pose well before manual recovery opens. That pull
 * is the difference between funny and creepy, and it is also what keeps the
 * tone non-graphic: the owner's standing answer (2026-08-11) is no blood,
 * and comedy carried by pose rather than by violence.
 *
 * The skeleton is eleven particles — pelvis, chest, head, a hip pair, a
 * shoulder pair, hands and feet — because that is the smallest set that
 * carries a full orientation frame (the hip and shoulder bars) plus the four
 * limb endpoints the render rig's existing two-bone solvers need as targets.
 * Elbows and knees deliberately do not exist here: the rig solves them
 * anatomically, so no joint can ever bend backwards no matter what the
 * particles do, which closes the "broken marionette" failure mode by
 * construction rather than by joint-limit tuning.
