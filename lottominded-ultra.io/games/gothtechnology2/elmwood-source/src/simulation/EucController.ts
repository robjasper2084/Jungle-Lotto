/**
 * The EUC controller — M2's ride, on M4's ground.
 *
 * **The game inverts the real EUC control loop.** On a real wheel the rider
 * leans and the firmware accelerates the wheel to stay underneath them. Here
 * `leanPitch` is a state variable driven toward the input target, and
 * acceleration is a function of lean. The player never balances. The visual,
 * audio, and camera feedback is identical to the real thing; the frustration is
 * absent. That inversion *is* the game (docs/PLANS.md §4).
 *
 * Two structural rules make this file what it is:
 *
 *   1. **No three.js import** (AGENTS.md invariant 1). Every curve below — the
 *      accel ramp, the top speed, the braking distance, the lateral clamp, the
 *      reverse gate, and now the slope term, the per-surface response, the
 *      step-up ceiling, and the suspension — is reachable from `node --test`
 *      with no browser, which is the only reason tuning by test is fast enough
 *      to be worth doing.
 *   2. **The world is reached only through `TerrainSampler`** (invariant 3).
 *
 * **What M4 changed, and what it deliberately did not.** The owner accepted the
 * M2/M3 ride, so terrain drives exactly the things `docs/PLANS.md` §4.1 and
 * §4.3 say terrain drives — the slope term, per-surface rolling resistance,
 * per-surface grip on the lateral limit, ground contact against real geometry,
 * and the suspension — and nothing else. On flat pavement every number below
 * reduces to the M2 controller exactly: the slope term is zero, pavement's
 * rolling resistance is the single value M2 shipped, and pavement's grip is
 * 1.0. The approved ride is unchanged on the ground it was approved on.
 *
 * Three specific restraints are worth naming so a later reader does not mistake
 * them for oversights:
 *
 *   - **Grip is lateral only.** It multiplies the lateral ceiling and nothing
 *     else — `maxLateralG` until M30 Phase 2, and the speed schedule of
 *     `simulation/lateralCeiling.ts` since, which returns exactly
 *     `maxLateralG` below `carveSpeed`.
 *     Folding it into brake authority would change an approved M2 number for a
 *     reason `docs/PLANS.md` does not state; rolling resistance already
 *     separates the surfaces longitudinally. Flagged for the owner.
 *   - **The reverse gate is untouched, so gravity cannot roll a stopped wheel
 *     backwards down a hill.** That is not an omission: an EUC actively holds
 *     its position on a slope, which is more authentic than a rollback, and the
 *     alternative would have terrain quietly rewriting a gate the owner
 *     approved. Hills still change climb and descent while moving, which is
 *     what the acceptance criteria ask for.
 *   - **No wobble on a kerb strike.** A kerb costs speed here and nothing more.
 *     Written at M4 as a deferral, answered at M6, and true again since M13
 *     removed the wobble half — this time permanently, because the owner's
 *     §13 q8 trigger set has no room in it for the ground you chose to ride on.
 *
 * **What M5 added: the wheel can leave the ground.** Everything under
 * `docs/PLANS.md` §4.4 is here — a one-button hop with a held-crouch bonus, a
 * ballistic airborne phase whose *travel direction is frozen at take-off*, a
 * three-input landing score, and a pedal strike whose clearance angle is
 * derived from the wheel's own geometry rather than written down. Two
 * structural consequences are worth reading before changing anything below:
 *
 *   - **Heading and travel direction are the same thing on the ground and two
 *     different things in the air.** §4.4 says velocity is never steerable in
 *     flight, so `airDirX/airDirZ` hold the take-off direction and the heading
 *     yaws independently at a quarter authority. The angle between them at
 *     touchdown is the landing score's misalignment term, and the component of
 *     the velocity across the new heading is simply scrubbed. Air control that
 *     cannot move the landing spot but can fix the attitude is precisely the
 *     trade the plan asks for.
 *   - **Riding off a ledge launches; riding down a hill does not.** The test
 *     is the same one that separates a kerb from a slope in `advance` below —
 *     a surface predicts its own fall, and only the excess beyond that
 *     prediction is a ledge. On a gradient the excess is zero at any steepness
 *     and any speed.
 *
 * **On flat pavement with nobody pressing hop, every number here is still bit-
 * for-bit M2's.** The airborne branches are gated on a state that only a hop or
 * a ledge can enter, the pedal strike cannot fire below 0.55 rad of lean, and a
 * landing that never happens costs nothing. A headless test asserts that
 * reduction directly.
 *
 * **What M6 added: consequences.** `docs/PLANS.md` §4.5's three systems are
 * here — a driven damped oscillator on yaw, one `loadFactor` scalar driving a
 * four-stage power ladder that ends in tilt-back, and a non-graphic crash with
 * a fast recovery at the last validated safe position. Four things about them
 * are worth reading before changing anything below:
 *
 *   - **The wobble is a real deviation, not a decoration.** `wobbleYaw` is
 *     added to the heading the wheel actually travels along, so a wobbling
 *     rider weaves. It averages to zero over a cycle, so it costs them their
 *     line and their nerve without stealing the direction they chose — and the
 *     *stored* heading never sees it, so an oscillation can never accumulate
 *     into a turn.
 *   - **Recovery has two layers.** Once a real wobble begins, Cool Rider's
 *     automatic foot correction adds damping even while throttle is held;
 *     easing off and steering smoothly adds more. That second layer is the
 *     whole of the owner's q8 rule — *if the rider does not reduce speed to
 *     correct it, they crash*.
 *   - **M13 replaced what starts one, and what it looks like when it does.**
 *     The trigger set is authored hazards and nothing else, so rough ground, speed, a
 *     scraping pedal, a reversed carve, a kerb and a hard landing all stopped
 *     feeding the oscillator; and the amplitude lost its visibility threshold,
 *     so the wheel weaves from the first hundredth of a point rather than
 *     staying still until a dead band is crossed. Those two changes are one
 *     change: the threshold only existed to stop rough ground weaving forever,
 *     and rough ground no longer supplies anything.
 *   - **Tilt-back is a ceiling on the force lean, not a separate force.** A
 *     real wheel tips its pedals back until the rider must lean back with them;
 *     in this inverted control loop that is exactly `min(demand, ceiling)` with
 *     the ceiling pulled past neutral. With no tilt-back the ceiling is
 *     `maxLeanPitch` and the expression reduces to M2's line unchanged.
 *   - **M15 gives the crash its own temporary body.** The scripted separation
 *     still exists as the A/B fallback, but the default crash seeds an
 *     eleven-particle ragdoll that exists only inside `crashing`, collides
 *     through the sampler, and maps back onto the existing rig. The wheel
 *     keeps rolling through the same `advance` every other step uses, so it
 *     cannot roll through a wall while nobody is steering it.
 *
 * On flat pavement none of it fires — and since M13 that is true of every
 * surface, because the only ground with a non-zero `wobbleInjection` is the
 * spill. Flat-out riding still produces about two thirds of the load tilt-back
 * needs. The same headless test that asserts the M2 reduction asserts that too.
 *
 * Still absent, with named owners: the beep and the amber HUD that
 * `docs/PLANS.md` §4.5 names as the ladder's first two rungs (audio is M8, the
 * HUD is M9 — M6 answers them with the machine's own status light instead, see
 * `data/tuning.ts`), and cutout (DEFERRED). Camera shake was briefly built at
 * M9 and then removed by the owner; simulation never owned it.
 *
 * **Refined after the owner's M4 ride (2026-08-02), forces untouched:** the
 * rig no longer tilts fore-aft with the terrain (an EUC holds its pedals level
 * with gravity — the M4 surface-normal alignment leaned the rider *away* from
 * climbs); the rider instead leans into the hill by the gradient
 * (`slopeLean`), and a genuinely stopped rider blends into a one-foot-down
 * rest stance (`restFactor`). All three are presentation state; the
 * longitudinal model, steering, and every approved M2 curve are bit-for-bit
 * what they were.

 *
 *   - **Heading and wheel spin are unwrapped by the controller**, deliberately,
 *     so a plain lerp is correct. A wrapped angle would spin the rig a full
 *     turn every time it crossed the seam.
 *   - **`wobbleSway` is already `sin(phase)`**, so it is continuous when the
 *     phase wraps and interpolates like any other scalar. M13's first pass
 *     sampled the current step instead, on the theory that adjacent sine
 *     samples could jump from +1 to −1; at 120 Hz and at most 7 Hz they cannot,
 *     and sampling gave the feet a one-step phase lead.
 *   - **The ragdoll block is world positions**, so a per-float lerp is a lerp
 *     of each particle's own path — exactly what the fixed step integrated
 *     between these two states. It is skipped entirely at zero blend, which is
 *     every frame but a crash.

   * and the power ladder's landing load) but stopped feeding the oscillator.
   * What is left is the ground the rider is standing on and the impulses
   * `injectWobble` is handed, which after M13 means hazards.
   *
   * Two details survive from M6 unchanged because they were never the problem.
   *
   * **Damping is proportional to the energy**, which is what makes this a
   * damped oscillator rather than a constant drain. Passive damping is joined
   * by two recovery layers: Cool Rider automatically re-centres their feet once
   * a real wobble begins, and easing/slowing adds the stronger player-
   * controlled damping. That second layer is the whole answer to q8's "if the
   * rider does not reduce speed to correct it, they crash".
   *
   * **The amplitude is simply proportional to the energy**, with no visibility
   * threshold — which is the look the owner accepted before M6's rework and

   * simulation: an oscillator for the weave and the sway, a metre count for
   * the stumble, and the gates that keep it a joke rather than a hand on the
   * wheel. Nothing here touches speed, grip, lean, wobble energy, a crash or a

   * digests hold that a sober style makes every line here a `+ 0`.
   *
   *   - **The weave** is a bounded heading *offset*, `weaveHeading` times the
   *     sway, held to a constant lateral excursion above cruising. What joins
   *     the steering request — ahead of the lateral clamp, so grip bounds it
   *     — is the offset's change per step as a yaw rate. An offset rather
   *     than a rate is what makes the weave drift-free by construction: when
   *     the gate closes the offset eases to zero and the heading is back
   *     exactly where it was, where a rate gated off mid-cycle left a
   *     residual heading every time (measured: 2°, 19 m over a minute).
   *   - **The sway** is the weave's normalised yaw rate — two incommensurate
   *     cosines, so it never reads as a metronome — and it is the same number
   *     the rig leans the body by, which is what phase-locks the body to the
   *     path.
   *   - **The gate** is zero below walking pace, full at cruising, zero in
   *     reverse (the speed is signed), zero in the air, fading out as a real
   *     wobble becomes an event and back in as it damps, zero in a crash and
   *     the invulnerable window after one, and faded by `(1 − |steer|)²` so a
   *     player threading a gap never feels a hand on the wheel. Eased at the
   *     style's fade rate, so nothing switches — and so a stick let go brings
   *     the weave back as a settling, not a kick.
   *   - **The stumble** fires every `stumbleEvery` metres of riding — metres
   *     on the fixed step, so `advance(n)` reaches the same one every run —
   *     never in the air, in a wobble, in a crash or below walking pace, and
   *     never twice inside its spacing. It is a sine-enveloped shimmy of the
   *     machine's yaw and roll, spent on the travel heading like the wobble's
   *     and never on `headingY`; it enters no oscillator and cannot crash.
   *
   * Every `+ 0` below normalises a negative zero for `stepWobble`'s reason.

  /**
   * Is a pedal on the ground, and how far past clearance is it?
   *
   * **The clearance angle is derived from the wheel, not written down.** The
   * pedal's outer edge sits `pedalHalfSpan` from the centreline at
   * `pedalHeight` above the tread, so rolling about the contact patch brings
   * it to the ground at `atan(height / halfSpan)`. At the blocked-out
   * dimensions that is 0.55 rad — 31.7 degrees — which is where a real 18-inch
   * wheel with these pedals would scrape, and it moves on its own the moment
   * either dimension does.
   *
   * **The suspension is deliberately not in it, and that was a decision.**
   * `EUC_RIDER_MOTION_REFERENCE.md` §14 lists "hard compression while turning"
   * as a trigger, and folding the spring's travel into the height above is one
   * line. It was built that way and then taken out again, for three reasons
   * worth recording so nobody puts it back without meaning to:
   *
   *   - `docs/PLANS.md` §4.4 states the condition as `grounded and |rollAngle|
   *     > PEDAL_CLEARANCE_ANGLE` — a constant angle, not a moving one.
   *   - §4.3 says the suspension "only lightly modulates grip and is not
   *     load-bearing". Letting it decide when a pedal scrapes makes it
   *     load-bearing, which is a settled decision to reopen rather than to
   *     take in passing.
   *   - The spring is driven by a *spatial* roughness field, so two mirrored
   *     carves ride different ground. Coupling it in made a left-hand corner
   *     cost measurably more than the right-hand one for reasons no player
   *     could see, and broke two pieces of accepted M2/M3 evidence that assert
   *     the two are identical. That asymmetry is the tell: it was not a
   *     feature, it was terrain noise reaching the force model.
   *
   * Reopening it is a real feature and a good one — flagged in `CHANGELOG.md`
   * for the owner rather than settled here.
   *
   * Two consequences worth being explicit about. Pavement's 0.75 g lateral
   * ceiling allows 0.64 rad of lean, so a sustained full-lock carve on a hard
   * surface scrapes — that is §4.4's "learnable limit". Grass and gravel cap
   * the lean below the clearance angle through their grip, so they never do,
   * which is exactly how it works in life.

   *     finish and land on one step — and `land()` clears `spinArmed` and
   *     `spinRemaining` on that same step, which is why a completed 180 and no
   *     spin at all are indistinguishable there. A flag cleared at the landing
   *     would therefore be false on the only step an observer watching
   *     `touchedDown` can read it. It is cleared at the next `leaveGround`
   *     instead: the first moment the answer could belong to a different
   *     flight.
   *   - **A crash does not clear it.** `beginCrash` leaves it alone
   *     deliberately. A rider who completes the rotation and then wads the
   *     landing has still turned the machine around; whether that earns
   *     anything is a judgement for the observer, made from

 * the flat produces, the last where the throttle stops answering. A consumer

 * the machine's status light showed in its first browser capture: nearly amber
 * while the state was still `notice`.
 *
 * The result is `k / rungs.length` at the k-th rung, and it interpolates
 * linearly between them.
 *
 * **Rungs are forced to ascend rather than assumed to.** Every one of them is
 * on F4, and an owner who drags the tilt-back rung below the amber one would
 * otherwise get a status light running backwards — which is precisely what the
 * first browser capture of a lowered tilt-back showed: a wheel reporting
 * `tiltBack` with a yellow-green light. A rung dragged under its predecessor
 * simply becomes unreachable, which is also what the stage machine does with
