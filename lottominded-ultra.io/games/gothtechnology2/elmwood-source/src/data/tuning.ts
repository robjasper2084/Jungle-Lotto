/**
 * Central tuning configuration.
 *
 * Every constant that shapes how the game looks, feels, or performs lives
 * here — grouped, documented, and stated with units. Controller and renderer
 * files must not carry unexplained numeric literals (AGENTS.md invariant 4).
 *
 * **One table is not here: the per-surface one.** `data/surfaces.ts` owns
 * rolling resistance, grip, roughness, particles, tyre voices, and materials,
 * because `docs/PLANS.md` §4.3 names that file and because those values are
 * indexed by surface rather than global. It is re-exported into the frozen root
 * at the bottom of this file so the tuning panel can still address one by path.
 *
 * WORLD CONVENTIONS, applied everywhere without exception:
 *   - Units are metres, seconds, radians, and kilograms.
 *   - +Y is up.
 *   - +Z is forward (the direction the rider faces at rest).
 *   - **+X is the rider's LEFT. Their right is -X.**
 *   - **A positive yaw about +Y turns LEFT. Steering right is negative yaw.**
 *
 * Right-handed, so `right = forward x up`. At rest that is
 * `(0,0,1) x (0,1,0) = (-1,0,0)`.
 *
 * **Corrected at M2, and worth reading before deriving anything from it.**
 * This block previously said "+X is right, right-handed: right = up x
 * forward". Those two claims cannot both hold. `up x forward` is the
 * *left*-handed (Unity, DirectX) identity; three.js is right-handed, and in a
 * right-handed frame with +Y up and +Z forward, +X necessarily lands on the
 * rider's left. The consequence was not academic: steering right carved left
 * on screen, and the rider leaned out of every corner instead of into it.
 *
 * Derive facings and steering signs from the two axis facts above rather than
 * eyeballing which way looks correct — and when in doubt, check it the way the
 * error was actually found: project a point on the rider's right to screen
 * space and confirm it lands on the right. `tests/m2.spec.ts` does exactly
 * that, and it is the only test that can.
 *
 * COLOUR AUTHORING: hex values below are sRGB and three.js decodes them to
 * linear before lighting. "6% darker" in sRGB is not 6% darker in linear —
 * 0.86 sRGB is about 0.70 linear. Pick the darkening you want in linear terms
 * and raise it to the power 1/2.2 to get the hex value. Values that look
 * almost white in a colour picker are often the correct ones.

   * The one-foot air gesture — M36, `docs/PLANS.md` §36.5.
   *
   * **The airborne exception to two-foot contact, and nothing else.** The
   * motion reference has both boots on their pedals at all times; this is the
   * one pose that leaves, it happens only in flight, and the three offsets
   * below are the whole of it. They are an *ankle target* — the existing
   * two-bone leg solve does the articulation, so there is no new joint, no new
   * geometry and no second opinion about where a knee may bend.
   *
   * Offsets from the free foot's own pedal target, after the pedal's yaw and
   * roll have been applied to it: the gesture rides the machine's pedal the
   * way every other foot offset does, so a wobbling wheel does not leave the
   * gesture behind. `render/rider.ts` blends toward them by the channel's
   * 0..1 amount, so entry, hold and the return before touchdown are one
   * scalar and every interior value is a real pose.
   *
   * **The foot trails; it does not kick out sideways, and that was measured
   * rather than chosen.** The first build took the ankle out and up — 0.20 m
   * outboard, 0.14 m above the pedal — and it did not fit anybody's clothes.
   * Swept through `render/riderClearance.test.ts`, it put a leg 60 mm out
   * through Trollina's flare and 208 mm out through Seal's tied band, dropped
   * all four hip domes below their seat hems (7.6 mm against a 20 mm floor)
   * and took both jacket-hem contracts 6 mm under theirs. The cause is
   * anatomy: raising the ankle toward a fixed hip shortens the chain, the
   * knee has to bulge somewhere, and a knee only bulges *forward* — measured,
   * the thigh's top swept 190 mm out in front of the rider, which is what
   * walks through everything worn at the waist. §36.5's instruction where that
   * happens is to **reduce or redirect the gesture, never the floor**, so the
   * pose was redirected: the foot swings *back* and up and a little out, which
   * folds the shin behind the rider and leaves the thigh where it was. At
   * these numbers the two contracts that had failed worst read exactly their
   * gesture-free values, and every other floor holds untouched.
   *
   * It is also the direction the game can see. The chase camera sits behind
   * the rider, so a boot that swings back and up crosses the silhouette the
   * player is looking at, where the same distance sideways is mostly hidden
   * behind the machine.
   *
   * Sized against reach rather than taste: the free ankle ends about 0.63 m
   * from its hip, inside the 0.78 m the thigh and shin total, so the knee
   * keeps a real bend at the full gesture instead of solving a locked leg
   * that would stand the boot somewhere the constants do not say.
   *
   * **The hips do not move.** A weighted one-foot stance on the ground shifts
   * the mass over the supporting pedal; a rider in the air has no weight to
   * shift, and a hip shift here would move every garment on the pelvis through
   * every clearance contract in `render/riderClearance.test.ts` for a pose that

  //
  // `docs/PLANS.md` §4.5 settled all three before any was built: wobble is a
  // driven damped roll-yaw oscillator whose damping rises sharply with smooth
  // input, power is *one* scalar driving a four-stage ladder that ends in
  // tilt-back, and a crash is a short non-graphic separation with a fast
  // recovery at the last validated safe position.
  //
  // **Every number below is sized against one hard constraint: the ride the
  // owner accepted at M2 through M5 must be bit-for-bit unchanged.** Flat
  // pavement is the ground that ride was accepted on, and on it every term
  // here evaluates to exactly zero — and after M13 that is true of *every*
  // surface but the spill, because the trigger set is the owner's and it is
  // hazards only (§13 q8). The power ladder's tilt-back stage stays out of
  // reach without a hill, a bad landing, or a fight with the wheel. A headless
  // test asserts that reduction directly, the same way M4's and M5's do.
  //
  // **M13 deleted seven constants rather than zeroing them**, because a tuning
  // value nobody reads is a value that rots: `wobbleComfortSpeed`,
  // `wobbleSpeedGain`, `wobbleSteerReversalGain`, `wobbleReversalMemorySeconds`,
  // `wobblePedalStrikeGain`, `wobbleCurbGain` and `wobbleLandingGain` are gone
  // with the sources they scaled. The kerb still costs speed and the harsh
  // landing still spends power headroom; neither starts an oscillation now.

/**
 * What a pothole looks like — M13 Phase 2, redrawn after the owner's first look.
 *
 * **The constraint has not changed and never will: a recess cannot be drawn as
 * a recess.** The heightfield is an opaque surface at road height, so a ray from
 * the chase camera to any point below it crosses it first, and there is no cell
 * to cut either — a cell is a square metre, a pothole is smaller than one, and
 * cutting it would open a metre of void onto the backstop. Depth is carried by
 * *value* and by *shading*, and any real relief has to go up.
 *
 * **What changed is how much of it goes up, and why.** The first pass answered
 * the readability question with 0.23–0.28 m of spoil ring — the height a
 * projected-pixel measurement said was needed at 40 m — and the ring it produced
 * read as a tan volcano sitting on the asphalt. It was the right arithmetic
 * applied to the wrong cue. A raised ring is the *least* pothole-like shape a
 * road feature can have: a real hole crumbles **downward**, and a crown standing
 * a quarter of a metre proud of the road is a moulding, not a break.
 *
 * The relief here is now 0.05–0.07 m — a broken lip, the height of a chunk of
 * asphalt — and it is deliberately *not* the distance cue. Three other things
 * are, and each survives the shallow view better than height does:
 *
 *   1. **A luminance dipole.** Pale ring, dark core. A thin dark mark on grey
 *      asphalt averages back into the road as the pixels shrink; a light ring
 *      around a dark centre keeps a contrast edge, because the two halves fall
 *      on opposite sides of the road's value and cannot cancel. That is why the
 *      halo below is *brighter* than pavement and the pit is far darker.
 *   2. **An irregular outline.** Nothing else in the world has a ragged edge,
 *      so the shape alone is a signal — and the perfect 16-gon of the first pass
 *      was most of what made it read as manufactured. See `outlineHarmonics`.
 *   3. **Standing water**, in the deep kind only (`PUDDLE`). It is the cue every
 *      driver already owns, and it puts the crash-severity hazard in a different
 *      visual class from the wobble-severity one instead of merely a larger one.
 *
 * **The interior is still lit as a bowl although it is flat**, by carrying the
 * normals the recess would have had. That part was right and is kept. What is
 * added is a *baked ambient occlusion* term (`floorShade`, `wallShade`): a
 * cavity is occluded at the bottom no matter where the sun is, so this is a fact
 * about the shape rather than a second opinion about the lighting, and it does
 * not violate invariant 6 the way a baked sun azimuth would. Author the colours
 * below as the material in open daylight and let the shade terms dig the hole.
 *
 * **The drawn mouth is never smaller than the hit radius.** A `Hazard.radius` is
 * the distance at which the contact *point* is in the hole, and the jitter below
 * only ever pushes the rim *outward* from it, so a rider who clips the visible
 * edge is not charged. Generous in the direction a rider forgives. (The spill's
 * jitter runs the other way, and `PUDDLE` says why.)
 *
 * A pothole is **never a collider** (`level/plan.ts`): the wheel rolls through
 * the lip without feeling it. That is the honest cost, and at 5 cm it is a much
 * smaller lie than the 28 cm kerb the first pass asked the player to ride

   * was derived at M13 from the *live* wheel's own separation — "a hazard about
   * every two recovery distances" — and that derivation, handed a faster wheel
   * at M30 Phase 1, emptied the road: a longer recovery distance is a lower
   * chance per station, and a sixty-seed sweep lost a quarter of its holes at
   * 65 mph. That is the wrong way round. A faster wheel exists to be more
   * *thrilling* (the decision of 2026-09-03), so the road must not get emptier
   * as the wheel gets faster. The chance is therefore anchored on the
   * **shipped** wheel's derivation — which is what keeps a default build
   * byte-identical, since the anchor is then the same expression M13 wrote —
   * and scaled from it by the top-speed ratio raised to this power.
   *
   * The separation floor does **not** move with this taste and is not scaled by
   * it: two hazards inside one recovery is a crash the rider could not have
   * avoided, and an unavoidable crash is annoying, which this project removes
   * rather than tunes.
   *
   * **The number is chosen against a measured ladder, not against the
   * arithmetic**, because the arithmetic is an *offer* and the contracts refuse
   * most of it. At exponent 1 only 27 % of the extra placements landed: the
   * fairness floor above is wider at 65 in exactly the proportion the offer is
   * denser, and the zone, sight, gate, surface and lane rules absorb the rest.
   * So the offer has to be steep before the road reads as busier. What each
   * exponent actually lands at 65 mph, sixty seeds (`euc-1..60`), per route and
   * per minute of riding at the 28.98 m/s terminal over the sweep's own mean
   * required route of 1,080 m, with `route-41` and `x67` by name — no exponent
   * produced a fallback, and the shipped wheel is 5.07 a route and 6.26 a
   * minute for comparison:
   *
   *   - **0** — 4.62 a route (1–8), 7.43 a minute; `route-41` 6, `x67` 5. The
   *     offer is the shipped wheel's exactly, and the road still thins out,
   *     because the fairness floor is a third wider at 65 and refuses what the
   *     unchanged dice hand it. **Holding the offer still is not holding the
   *     count still** — that is the whole reason this constant exists.
   *   - **1** — 5.48 (3–8), 8.83 a minute; `route-41` 6, `x67` 9. Hazards per
   *     *metre* scale with the top speed, so per *second* they scale with its
   *     square. Only 27 % of the extra placements land: +8 % of a route, which
   *     is not a road anybody would call busier.
   *   - **2** — 6.12 (4–9), 9.85 a minute; `route-41` 6, `x67` 9.
   *   - **3** — 6.98 (5–9), 11.24 a minute; `route-41` 7, `x67` 10. **The
   *     shipped choice**: a 65 route carries about two more holes than the same
   *     road at 50 and meets them four-fifths again as often, and the floor
   *     still refuses every pair the rider could not recover between.
   *   - **6** — 8.60 (6–11), 13.84 a minute; `route-41` 10, `x67` 12. Recorded
   *     as the far end of the ladder rather than as a candidate.

   * **The ride settles it.** This is a taste and the numbers above only say

 *
 * ## There is no sun glint here, and there cannot be. Measured, not assumed.
 *
 * The obvious way to make a dark patch read as liquid is a specular highlight,
 * and two builds were spent trying to get one before the geometry was actually
 * worked out. **It is unreachable in this rig.** The sun sits at 55° of
 * elevation. The chase camera's eye is about 2 m up looking at road 6–40 m
 * ahead, so its line of sight meets the ground at 10–20°. A microfacet lobe
 * peaks when the surface normal equals the half-vector between the view and the
 * light, and for that pair the half-vector sits at about 41° of elevation —
 * which asks the water's normal to tilt roughly **49° from vertical**. That is
 * not a ripple, it is a wave, and there is no environment map to reflect
 * instead: one sun and one hemisphere is the whole rig (invariant 7 has already
 * ruled out the post pass that would fake it).
 *
 * So the read is built out of what this renderer *can* deliver:
 *
 *   1. **Value.** The body is roughly a seventh of the road's luminance, which
 *      measures as a 7:1 dipole at gameplay scale — plenty at any distance.
 *   2. **A bright meniscus.** A thin ring at the water's edge, brighter than the
 *      road and distinctly blue. This is the piece that stops the puddle reading
 *      as a shadow, and it is not a cheat: the edge of standing water is where
 *      the film is thinnest and the angle to the sky most grazing, so it really
 *      is the brightest part of a real puddle. It is also sun-independent, which
 *      a baked highlight would not be (invariant 6).
 *   3. **Hue.** Everything here is cool where the asphalt and the crushed stone
 *      around it are neutral-to-warm. Water takes its diffuse from the sky, and
 *      at the distance where neither hazard is more than a mark, hue is what
 *      says which one it is.
 *
 * The ripple survives all of that, at a much smaller amplitude and with a

   * first one that is **asymmetric**.
   *
   * Everything here was measured off `references/Maribel-Vargas/IMG_6600`
   * rather than picked by eye, which matters more than usual: that photograph
   * was taken in hard overhead sun, which is the light this game has, so its
   * readings are close to what the *render* should produce and the albedos
   * below sit a step under them. Where the AI render disagrees with the
   * photograph it loses (brief §5), and it disagrees loudly — it drives every
   * accent to picker saturation, which is exactly the value ACES throws away.
   *
   * **The structure is black with mid-grey panels**, which is what separates
   * her from the two black-suited riders already on the roster: Adonisb2 is
   * black head to foot with green armour, Cool Rider is one mid-grey-blue
   * garment. Hers is two values of neutral before any accent is applied.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * **Re-authored for value, M23 Phase A1b — and this block is the record of
   * why the measured version failed.**
   *
   * A1 shipped every one of her materials inside a ten-per-cent band of
   * brightness: suit `#33353e`, helmet `#36383f`, gear `#3d3f46`, hair
   * `#2f2622`. Each one was measured honestly off her own photographs, and
   * together they rendered a black void with a blue visor floating on it. The
   * owner's verdict was *"I am not happy with the design, at all"*, and the
   * §23.9c audit agreed with him and found the cause here rather than in the
   * polygon count.
   *
   * **A palette is a value story, and measuring reality does not author one.**
   * A photograph is a record of one light on one day; a game character is read
   * at forty pixels tall against a grey road, and every rider on this roster
   * that works has a two-step value story in it — Cool Rider's mid-grey against
   * black, Red Rider's red against charcoal, Adonisb2's green armour on black.
   * So from here the **hues stay measured** (they are hers, and the accents
   * below still sit where the photographs put them) and the **values are
   * designed**: helmet darkest, gear near it, suit a step up, panels a long
   * step above that, hair a light mass, the mark near-white. That spread is
   * the arcade-over-authenticity rule, applied for the first time to value
   * rather than to hue.
   *
   * The measurements stay in each comment as provenance. The shipped number is
   * a decision.
   *
   * Down from `#33353e`: the leather has to be the *floor* the panels step off,
   * and it was sitting where the panels should have been.

  // her mark, every panel — so a near-black ground meant the atlas could paint
  // whatever it liked and none of it could show. The chest page is fully
  // saturated on the sheet and rendered monochrome on the rider.
  //
  // It is also more faithful, not less. Black leather in direct sun is a

   * *darker* than the suit in every channel, and a vertex colour is a
   * multiplier, so all of it is reached by painting **down** from
   * `floWithZoSilver`. Only the guard white is above the suit, and the guards
   * are patches in the `accent` role with their own material. That leaves the
   * rider with no atlas, no print and no page anywhere on him — the first
   * real-person rider on the roster where that is true.
   *
   * **`floWithZoPanel` is the paint target of the vest, the shoulder cap and
   * the outer thigh**, warm-neutral so it does not compete with the cyan for
   * the eye, and **0.58 of the ground in linear since the r2 gauntlet** — it
   * was authored at 0.37 on a reading of PHOTO 1 that turned out to be the
   * panel's own shadowed side. Two blind critics in that round measured the
   * same tier from opposite ends: the chest plate rendered at **0.43 × the
   * light suit beside it** where PHOTO 1 gives 0.56–0.67, and the shoulder cap
   * at **0.47–0.55 ×** where PHOTO 1's shoulder panelling gives 0.78 and
   * PHOTO 2's lit shoulder 1.00, so a critic asked for the caps to be deleted
   * as charcoal the photographs do not carry. The verifier's ruling was
   * *repaint, do not delete* (`flo-views/_scratch/gauntlet-r2-record.md` §D
   * 2b / 2c), and one value serves all four surfaces the key paints, since the
   * vest, the cap, the outer thigh and the collar are one tint by
   * construction. `0xacaba5` holds the key's own hue (51°) and saturation
   * (0.046) and lands the rendered pair at ≈ 0.63 and ≈ 0.81 — and it stays
   * one step **above** `floWithZoBronze`'s 0.54, so the value ladder from suit
   * to panel to lid still falls in one direction.
   *
   * **`floWithZoGuard` is the knee and thigh armour** — moulded plastic reads
   * a stop above knit under the same sun (`tuning.ts:4344`, Wheel in
   * Motion's), which is what keeps the biggest volume on his legs from
   * reading as more trouser.
   *
   * **`floWithZoGear` is the value floor, not black.** Gloves, collar, elbow
   * patches, the guards' joints and the sole: a real black in sun is a
   * mid-dark grey in albedo (`DESIGN.md` §7k), so the red byte is 60 and no
   * lower, and the hue is held clear of the seven near-blacks already taken.
   *
   * **`floWithZoBronze` is the lid** — a near-neutral pewter since the r1
   * gauntlet, and the key keeps its name because `docs/PLANS.md` §34 is
   * frozen until Phase 4 (the name is the plan's, the value is the
   * photographs'). It was authored warm (`0xb2a28e`, hue 33°) and two blind
   * critics scored the same defect independently: measured head-against-suit
   * inside one frame, the game read R−B **+26** on the shell against **+3**
   * on the suit where both photographs run 1 to 10 points **cooler** than
   * the body, so the head's colour temperature was inverted against the
   * rider wearing it. `0xa8a5a1` normalises warmth to R−B / L 0.042 against
   * the suit's 0.041 (the photographs' pairs are 1.01 × and 1.17 ×) and
   * **holds the value**: Ylin 0.378 against the bronze's 0.373, still
   * ≈ 0.53 × the suit's and inside the 0.47–0.60 window a lid may take
   * before it reads as a void from behind (`flo-views/_scratch/gauntlet-r1-record.md`
   * §C 1a / 6a). Its roughness stays where a capture of the crown put it.
   *
   * **`floWithZoLens` is the visor's brightest value** (the page over it can
   * only darken): a dark cool smoke sitting between `wheelInMotionLens` and
   * Red Rider's.
   *
   * **The hem band is two hues, and handedness is a test.** `floWithZoCyan`
   * at hue 188° threads the gap between the roster's teals (177°) and its
   * azures (202°, 214°); `floWithZoGold` at hue 38° is PHOTO 2's `#ecba70`.
   * They meet at the spine — cyan on his **right**, gold on his **left**
   * (`docs/PLANS.md` §34.4; `floWithZo.test.ts` asserts the multiplier on the
   * built torso rather than trusting the author's mirror).
   *
   * **His wheel** (§34.5), in the direction the multiplier honours:
   * `machineFloWithZo` is a neutral graphite shell with headroom — 1.5 × the
   * luminance of Wheel in Motion's `0x24262b` and under Adonisb2's
   * `0x303338`, so the bezel behind the status light and the nose recess can
   * still be painted down from it. `machineFloWithZoTrim` is the pale trim
   * base *and* the pads' own colour (the first pale pedals on the roster),
   * and every accent on the machine is tinted down from it.
   * `machineFloWithZoOrange` is the one warm accent — hue ≈ 22°, between
   * PHOTO 1's badge at 17° and PHOTO 2's rim at 28°, ≥ 5° from the
   * Drunkard's amber on the `drunkard.test.ts:1210` precedent and
   * deliberately not `wheelInMotionOrange`'s hex. The photographs put that
   * orange on the *tyre*, which has no paint hook and no per-channel tint, so
   * it lives low on the flanks and on a nose badge instead (§34.5).

  /**
   * Seal on a Wheel — M35 (`docs/PLANS.md` §35.4 for the rider, §35.5 for the
   * wheel). A real EUC rider, in the game on a public ask of his own, read off
   * three frames of his own riding video first and the target render second.
   * **Phase 0 lands all eighteen keys at once** so that Phases 1 and 2 tune
   * *values* on lines they each own rather than adding blocks to this file at
   * the same time; the names are fixed, the numbers may move.
   *
   * **Every hue below is quoted twice, and the two are not interchangeable.**
   * The sRGB hue is what a picker and the reference photographs speak; the
   * linear hue is what `new THREE.Color(hex).getHSL()` returns and what the
   * per-rider separation tests actually measure (`floWithZo.test.ts:100`).
   * They diverge by up to 13° on this rider's colours, and in the reds they
   * *compress* — see the lid below, which is the one place a rule and a space
   * disagree.
   *
   * **He is the mirror image of FloWithZo, and that decides the whole family.**
   * Everything he wears is black, so the ground is the *floor* rather than the
   * ceiling: his two bright things — the tied sweatshirt and the lid's white —
   * are far lighter than the kit and cannot be reached by a vertex-colour
   * multiplier from it at all, which is why `sealGarment` and
   * `sealHelmetWhite` are their own roles rather than paint (§35.2, and
   * `floWithZoGuard`'s precedent at the other end of the same argument).
   *
   * **`sealGear` is the ground and the value floor**: the short-sleeved black
   * top, authored as the mid-dark grey a real black garment is in sun, red
   * byte **70** and no lower (`DESIGN.md` §7k, the rule `floWithZoGear` states
   * as "60 and no lower"). sRGB hue 228°, linear 229°.
   *
   * **The rest of the blacks are separated by value, in the order the
   * references rank them**, because there is no hue room left — the shipped
   * table already holds eight near-black gear greys inside 218–228° and five
   * near-black machine bodies, and in the target render every black surface on
   * him sits between Ylin 0.004 and 0.047. The ladder authored here, in linear
   * luminance: `sealPack` **0.047** (the darkest thing he wears — a black
   * day-pack reads as a hole beside knit), `sealBoot` 0.051, `sealGlove`
   * 0.056, `sealHelmetBlack` 0.059, `sealTrouser` 0.061, `sealGear` **0.065**
   * (the ground), `sealPad` **0.089**. The pads are the only surface lifted a
   * whole stop: moulded plastic reads a stop above knit under the same sun
   * (`tuning.ts:4344`, Wheel in Motion's), and his knee shells are the biggest
   * volume on his legs. `sealTrouser` sits at the top's value a touch warmer
   * and greyer — sRGB 245° against the top's 228°, the direction the
   * photographs give (trousers 250–252°, top 222–240°) rather than their
   * shade-lit absolute.
   *
   * **`sealGarment` is the sweatshirt knotted at his waist, and it carries the
   * whole value range on the body.** A cool light grey at Ylin **0.718** — the
   * brightest thing on him by ten to thirty times and still below
   * `floWithZoGuard` (0.795) and well below `wheelInMotionPrint` (0.962), so
   * the roster's brightest garment does not change hands. Authored grey and
   * not white: the target render's sunlit `#dcdce8` is the saturated extreme
   * and the photographs' shade-lit `#a3a8c3` the other, and a white here would
   * blow out under ACES the way a saturated primary does.
   *
   * **Phase 1 moved it up its own band, from Ylin 0.681 to 0.718, because it
   * is also the lid's printing ground** — hue held exactly (sRGB 229.1°,
   * linear 229.4°), value taken to the top of §35.2's authorized 0.62–0.72.
   * The helmet is a code-painted page and `inkOver` divides and clamps at one,
   * so the page's ground has to stand at or above every ink on it in every
   * channel; none of the lid's own three colours does, and adding a
   * fifteenth key for a surface no player can see would be a colour nobody
   * could point at. The garment's grey clears the red's red byte exactly and
   * the white and black comfortably, so `materials.head` wears it and every
   * texel of the lid inks over it. `sealOnAWheel.test.ts` holds that relation
   * rather than this paragraph: the ground dominates every ink in every
   * channel, or the page would clamp and the red would quietly render as the
   * ground.
   *
   * **The lid is three colours and one of them is the tightest hue in the
   * build.** `sealHelmetRed` is authored at sRGB **351.5°** — q148's default,
   * 5.1° clear of `maribelCoral` (346.4°) and 5.9° clear of `redRiderHelmet`
   * (357.4°), the two *rider* reds, and 3.9° from `taillight` (355.4°) on
   * `redRiderHelmet`'s own precedent that a rider colour may sit a degree from
   * a machine lamp. **In linear space that clearance is not there and cannot
   * be**: the whole red arc this roster owns compresses into 353.8–359.1°
   * (`maribelCoral` 353.8, `taillight` and `machineRed` 359.0,
   * `redRiderHelmet` 359.1, `statusCritical` 0.0), a span of 6.2° in which no
   * red clears any other by five. His lands at linear 356.9 — 3.1° from
   * `maribelCoral` and 2.3° from `redRiderHelmet` — so the honest statement of
   * the separation is sRGB hue plus value and saturation, and Phase 1's test
   * says so rather than asserting a bar that no red on this roster could pass.
   * **Phase 1 held both hues and the saturation and lowered the value one
   * notch — Ylin 0.195 → 0.175, sRGB 351.5°, HSV S 0.78 unchanged — because
   * the lid is printed and its ground has to stand above it** (see
   * `sealGarment`). A uniform scale of the gamma-encoded channels is a uniform
   * scale of the linear ones, so neither hue moved and the 5.1°/5.9° sRGB
   * clearances are the numbers above; 0.175 is inside §35.2's authored
   * 0.17–0.22 band, and the lid is still the brightest thing above his waist
   * by 2.7 × the top.
   * `sealHelmetWhite` is a cool off-white at Ylin **0.681**, a hair under the
   * garment; `sealHelmetBlack` is the brow band, the eye-port surround and the
   * lower chin bar, on the same floor as the kit. Area order on the page is
   * **red > black > white**, which is what the photographs give.
   *
   * **The white rose 17 % in M35's r3 fix pass, and it is the round's one
   * colour miss.** Two blind critics reached it from opposite ends of the rider
   * — the helmet's and the chase camera's — and the albedo settles it without
   * either one's pixel box: the shipped pair rendered the sash at **1.235 ×**
   * the lid's white, where all three stills rank them the other way (PHOTO 2
   * waist cloth ÷ chin flash **0.66**, PHOTO 1 rear pale band **0.60**, PHOTO 3
   * at the knot 0.94). That inversion is what made the garment the loudest
   * thing on him at gameplay distance. **The lid is the only lever**: the
   * garment's floor is spoken for by `sealNeon` at 0.685 and a shipped
   * assertion that the rand stays under it, so `sealGarment` can fall 3 % and
   * no further without reversing r2's blocker fix. `0xd0d8e3` lands the ratio
   * at **1.054**, moves the sRGB hue 217.5° → **214.7°** and the saturation
   * 0.076 → 0.084 — the blue-cast half of the finding was refuted on PHOTO 1's
   * own lid whites (hue 218–219 at S 0.14–0.15, at least as blue as this key),
   * so the hue stays inside five degrees and only the value is the fix. The
   * print ground still dominates it on every channel, with blue the tightest at
   * **98.0 %** of the ground. **The residual is recorded rather than rounded
   * away**: §35.2's two authoring bands — the lid at 0.55–0.62, the garment at
   * 0.62–0.72 — cannot both hold with the photographs' own ratio, and closing
   * the rest needs a fifteenth colour key (a near-white print ground of the
   * lid's own) that §35.2 and §35.4 declined on purpose
   * (`seal-views/_scratch/gauntlet-r3-record.md` §C-3 and §E 1).
   *
   * **`sealVisor` is the visor's brightest value** (the print over it can only
   * darken): a dark cool smoke at Ylin 0.028, between `floWithZoLens` (0.052)
   * and `redRiderVisor` (0.012). It is the one deliberate departure from the
   * photographs, where the visor is up and his face is visible in all three
   * frames — the roster is helmeted and a real person's face is the wrong call
   * (§35.2, the brief and the render agree).
   *
   * **`sealGloveRed` is real, not invented**: the photographs give a red
   * palm-and-knuckle section at sRGB 337–341° and the target render `#90131f`
   * at 354°. It is authored as the lid's own red taken down to Ylin 0.072 —
   * one family, two values — so a patch the size of a knuckle does not
   * introduce a tenth red to the table.
   *
   * **`sealNeon` is the shoe accent, and it is yellow rather than lime.** The
   * photographs give sRGB 49–62° and the render 65°; 58.5° is the one slot
   * that clears both `copHiVis` (52.4°, by 6.1) and `maribelHiVis` (66.4°, by
   * 7.9), and in linear the same pair is 10.7° and 15.3° away. It is authored
   * for the rand *above* the pedal line, because the pedal covers the bottom
   * quarter of the sole at every capture angle (`paintFloBoot`'s device).
   *
   * **Its saturation fell by a quarter in M35's r3 fix pass and its hue did
   * not** (§E 2, the gauntlet's second-largest measured miss). Hue-filtered
   * inside one frame, PHOTO 1's sunlit sole reads p95 **S 0.31 at v 0.94**
   * where `0xd8d43b` rendered p95 **S 0.66 at v 0.73** — double the saturation
   * at two thirds the value, a lime rather than a pale yellow — and the
   * within-frame ordering flipped with it: the photograph's sole peaks *above*
   * its own garment and the road line, the shipped rand peaked *below* its own
   * sash. This milestone's own measurement sheet says the same thing against
   * the key (`research/reference-measure.md` records the photographs at S 0.34
   * and the target render at 0.60–0.77): the authored value took the target's
   * saturation. `0xe0dd65` is **S 0.549, V 0.878, Ylin 0.685** at sRGB 58.6°,
   * and both narrowings off the critic's literal S 0.30–0.35 at V 0.95 are the
   * plan's own — §35.7's caveat runs a shade-lit still 0.15–0.30 under the
   * paint, and §35.2 makes the tied sweatshirt the brightest thing on the body,
   * which caps this under `sealGarment`'s 0.717. The hue moves by a tenth of a
   * degree, so both five-degree clearances above survive in sRGB and in linear.
   *
   * **`sealSkin` is the roster's first fair skin**: sRGB 17.0°, S 0.25,
   * Ylin 0.611 — paler and cooler than the four tans already here
   * (`coolSkin` 23.8°, `trollinaSkin` 23.4°, `copSkin` 25.6°, `drunkardSkin`
   * 27.9°), which is what the photographs give. It matters more on him than on
   * anyone: his sleeve hem is high on the upper arm and his glove cuff is
   * short, so bare forearm and upper arm are the only large warm area anywhere
   * on an all-black rider, and they are a real read cue at chase distance.
   *
   * **The value rose 9.5 % in M35's r2 fix pass and the hue did not.** A skin
   * key cannot be judged against the roster, because every other rider stands
   * in different kit, so r1's piece 4 judged it the only way a photograph
   * allows — as a ratio inside one frame. PHOTO 1's sunlit frame gives forearm
   * ÷ garment **0.77–0.93** and upper arm ÷ garment **1.28–1.55**; `0xd4b5a9`
   * stood at 0.696 against his own sweatshirt and rendered 0.48, a full step
   * dark beside the brightest thing he wears. `0xe8c6b9` is the same three
   * bytes scaled by 1.093, which lands the ratio at 0.851 and leaves HSV hue
   * and saturation where they were to a rounding step — the warmth half of the
   * finding is a shade-lit read and was not confirmed
   * (`seal-views/_scratch/gauntlet-r1-record.md` §E 8).
   *
   * **And the chroma came up in the r3 pass, with the hue held again.** This is
   * the one axis of the key three rounds agree on against the shipped value:
   * §35.2's authoring row asks **S 0.30–0.35** and the stills, measured
   * in-frame, give **0.22–0.26** (PHOTO 2 0.26 at 10°, PHOTO 1 0.22 at 3°,
   * PHOTO 3 0.23 at 12°), so `0xe8c6b9`'s 0.203 sat under even the unadjusted
   * floor. What it cost is visible rather than theoretical: a red-dominant
   * albedo under a blue ambient loses its green channel fastest, so his shaded
   * forearms rendered **S 0.05–0.07 at hue 320–324** — a grey-mauve, on the one
   * large warm area an all-black rider has. `0xefc4b3` is **S 0.251** at sRGB
   * **17.0°** and linear 14.7°, so the hue moves by less than half a degree in
   * both spaces, the four tans still clear it by five (`coolSkin` by 6.8°), and
   * **Ylin 0.6105 → 0.6109 holds r1's confirmed skin ÷ garment 0.851 to three
   * decimals**. The warm half is refused for the third time on the same
   * reading: the stills run 10–20° bluer than the paint, and a skin hue reading
   * bluer reads *lower* on the circle (r3 §C-5, §E 4a).
   *
   * **His wheel** (§35.5). **`machineSealCyan` is the shell, and this is the
   * one axis where the render is the authority over the photographs.** The
   * stills give sRGB 200–202°, which is `machineWheelInMotionBlue`'s hue
   * exactly and unusable under the 5° rule; the render's 194° lands in the only
   * open slot. Authored at sRGB **194.1°** (linear 205.1): 5.8° from
   * `floWithZoCyan` (188.3°) and 5.9° from `machineWheelInMotionBlue` (200.0°)
   * in sRGB, 10.1° and 7.7° in linear, so it clears both machine cyans in both
   * spaces. **The one neighbour it does not clear is `maribelVisor`**
   * (sRGB 195.1°, linear 201.1°) at 1.0° and 4.0° — there is no hue between
   * `floWithZoCyan` and `wheelInMotionBlue` that clears it, and it is a
   * *rider's visor* rather than a machine accent, three stops brighter
   * (Ylin 0.499 against 0.339) and never seen beside a wheel. Stated here so a
   * critic scoring the arc is not surprised by it. The value is authored a stop
   * deeper than the render's lit `#32ccfd` for `redRiderSuit`'s reason: a
   * saturated primary at the top of the gamut bleaches under ACES in sun.
   * `machineSealPad` is the same hue a stop above the body (Ylin 0.429 against
   * 0.339) — q149's Option A, cyan pads, because the shin-height mass is cyan
   * in all three references and the brief's "what to avoid" names the wrong
   * balance.
   *
   * **`machineSealPink` is the trim, and it is the only pink on the roster
   * that is not Trollina's.** sRGB **331.0°** against her three magentas at
   * 321.6–323.4° — 7.6° to 9.4° clear in sRGB and 9.0° to 10.2° in linear
   * (342.9° against 332.7–334.3°) — which is the margin §35.2 asks for.
   * Cyan stays dominant by area (the references run 0.23–0.44 pink to cyan);
   * the pink is the high-front pad plate, the flank bars, the bumper wedges
   * and the rear shoulders.
   *
   * **`machineSealTrim` is not a colour you will see** — it is the pale base
   * every pink patch is tinted *down* from, and its contract is arithmetic:
   * `tintOver` divides, so the base has to be **greater than or equal to the
   * pink in every channel** or a patch would need a material of its own.
   * `0xe4e6ea` is (228, 230, 234) against the pink's (226, 48, 134), which
   * holds with two counts of headroom on the tightest channel. It is a cool
   * near-white rather than FloWithZo's warm one so that nothing on this wheel
   * reads as his.
   *
   * **No red goes anywhere near the wheel**, and nothing is lost by that: the
   * references put none there, and a machine red collides with
   * `statusCritical` (`tuning.ts:3637-3644`).

  /**
   * The ghost, and the checkpoint gates (M10).
   *
   * **Authored here rather than in the render modules that draw them, because
   * both are members of the coupled visual system** (invariant 6, `DESIGN.md`
   * §6). The ghost is a transparent rider standing in the same light as the
   * real one and the gates carry an emissive term, so neither can be picked in
   * isolation — they are judged against the same exposure and tone mapping as
   * the status light and the head and tail lamps above.
   *
   * `ghost` is deliberately *not* a tinted Cool Rider. A translucent copy of
   * the player's own colours reads as a rendering fault — "why is my rider
   * see-through" — where a single cold, unlit-looking body reads as a
   * recording. One colour for the whole ghost also collapses it to one
   * material, which is most of how a second riding rig fits in the draw-call
   * budget at all.
   *

 * EUC makes while you stand on it holding still. "Is the right thing the
 * loudest thing" is *mixing*, and it is answered by the duck depths at the
 * bottom of this group rather than by making warnings louder. A warning turned
 * up until it beats a full-throttle motor is a warning that hurts when the
 * wheel is quiet; a warning that ducks the motor is exactly as loud as it needs
 * to be at every speed.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **ARCADE, NOT SIMULATION — and no sound here may be annoying.** Stated by the
 * owner on 2026-08-03, and it outranks authenticity everywhere the two
 * disagree. The vision says the same thing about the whole game (§2): real EUC
 * behaviour *inspires*; fun decides. Four concrete rules follow. Each of them
 * has already overruled something a real wheel does, and rules 1 and 4 were
 * written after the owner rode the first pass and did not like what he heard:
 *
 *   1. **The motor is an electric machine, so it may not be synthesised like a
 *      combustion one.** The first pass used two sawtooths a few cents apart
 *      over a sub-octave with a 7 Hz tremolo. Every one of those is a standard
 *      ingredient of an engine patch — detuning is how you get cylinders out of
 *      phase, a modulated sub-octave is how you get a stroke — and together at
 *      a 143 Hz fundamental they read as a two-stroke, which is exactly what
 *      the owner heard. What replaced it is a stack of *exact* harmonics with
 *      no detuning and no modulation anywhere, brightened by a filter under
 *      load. Nothing here may beat, chorus, or pulse.
 *   2. **No isolated sustained tone above about 1.5 kHz.** A real EUC's PWM
 *      carrier sings at 8–16 kHz. The first pass had it at 7.8 kHz measuring
 *      66 dB clear of its neighbours, then at 1.9 kHz — and it is now gone
 *      entirely, because a fixed-pitch pure tone that plays whenever the player
 *      stops is the single most fatiguing shape a sustained sound can have at
 *      any level. A parked wheel is a soft low hum and nothing else.
 *   3. **A warning wins by ducking, never by hurting.** Real tilt-back alarms
 *      run at 90–95 dB deliberately. Here the top rung is a rounded tone at a
 *      moderate level over a bed pushed halfway down — the same message, and
 *      it can sound for a whole climb without becoming a reason to stop
 *      playing.
 *   4. **Nothing sustained is amplitude-modulated at all.** Modulation near
 *      100 Hz is a wasp, and the tyre is the one voice that plays continuously
 *      for minutes at a time. The tread pattern was authentic, audible, and the
 *      second thing the owner disliked; there is no LFO left in the ride bed.
 *   5. **Near-silence over solid surfaces — the motor makes no sound.** The
 *      owner, a real rider, after reviewing years of his own ride footage
 *      (2026-08-04): a real EUC over solid terrain is *nearly silent*; the
 *      only authentic sounds are a faint tyre note and the very ear-ring rule
 *      2 outlaws. Both synthesized passes failed not in timbre but in
 *      existing — any audible motor bed is more sound than the machine makes.
 *      So the motor levels below default to zero (the stack is kept, and F4
 *      can raise it, so the decision is reversible by ear), solid surfaces
 *      carry only a faint tyre bed, offroad carries a real recording, speed is
 *      told by wind, and danger by the warning ladder and the crash.
 *
 * A player should be able to ride for an hour. That is the test every value
 * below is set against, and it is a test the first pass failed.

   * flight banking. The first repeat pays `repeatDecay` of the whole flight
   * (tricks, bonus and clean landing together), the second `repeatDecay²`,

   * resets outright. Off the features is a "feature" of its own for this
   * clock, so flat-ground clean landings decay the same way. Everything is
   * timed on the run's own fixed steps, so a pause recovers nothing.
   *
   * **Why per feature and not per trick.** `docs/TRICK_BENCH.md` records the
   * road here: at the proposed values a rider who never moved out-scored the
   * routed line 37×; per-trick clocks (10 s, half then a quarter) closed
   * mindless spam but left a burst-then-rest farmer at 4×; fading instead of
   * resetting closed that but left a stander pacing one hop per window at
   * 4.9×; the launch gate (`featureLaunchRequired`) made flat ground worth
   * its landing alone — and Codex's follow-up found the same paced stander
   * *inside* a feature's zone still banking 4,032 in ninety seconds. Every
   * one of those clocks was keyed on the trick, and a trick is what a
   * feature and a stander have in common. The place is what they do not: a
   * routed lap revisits a feature once every ~90 s, so with a one-minute
   * window the honest rider is never docked (the per-trick clocks docked a
   * routed lap 33–56 %, because the timber corridor's three features sit
   * within forty metres), while camping one feature is worth about two
   * flights a run and rotating the corridor's three about five against the
   * lap's eight.
   *
   * **What that leaves open, measured by the blind QA pass (2026-09-14) and
   * pinned rather than decided.** The cap is two flights' worth *per feature*,
   * so it multiplies by however many features a stationary rider can reach:
   * the geometric sum is 896 points a feature at the measured 448-point

   * `skinny` and `stepUp` zones are 1.8 m apart on one straight and `stairs`
   * is on the same corridor, so camping two of them banks 1,708 and three of

 * current one, and the arithmetic is settled in `simulation/paddle.ts`. What
 * this constant guards is the *other* case: on a teleport — a manual reset, a
