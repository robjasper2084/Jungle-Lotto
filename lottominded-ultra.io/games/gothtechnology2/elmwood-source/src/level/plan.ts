 * at all — it would be a slab of ground at the height of the road, and the one

 * a trap. What transfers is the *authoring* half — a plain optional key resolved
 * by `buildPlan` against the finished heightfield, the absent-not-empty idiom,
 * and one instanced marker family. What does not transfer is the *detection*
 * half: `simulation/challenge.ts` tests a point — the wheel's contact patch —
 * against one expected volume, and a target reusing that would score when the
 * wheel drove through its ground footprint whether or not anybody swung, which
 * makes the swing decoration. A paddle strike is a **swept segment test on the
 * paddle head** (`simulation/paddle.ts`); Knockabout's separate body-knock path
 * sweeps the rider/EUC against the visible stand without making it solid.
 *
 * **A target is detection and render data, never a collider.** This is the M7
 * trap for the fourth time and in its worst form yet. The sampler resolves a
 * collider by its top face, so a target volume that ever reached `plan.solids`
 * would be a slab of ground at strike height that a rider lands on — and unlike
 * a gate the player rides under or a pothole whose whole point is that the
 * ground drops away, a target is *supposed to look solid*, so the pressure to
 * make it one is real. It is not one. The wheel rides straight through the stand
 * and nothing about the ride changes.
 *
 * **Two points, no heading, and that is what keeps the drawn thing and the hit
 * thing from disagreeing.** `base` is where the stand's foot meets the ground on
 * the verge; `centre` is the strike disc, cantilevered in over the road. The
 * renderer derives the arm's direction and length from `centre - base`, so there
 * is no separate heading anybody can set inconsistently. The paddle reads the
 * sphere at `centre`; the body-knock path reads both points as the visible
 * post-and-arm ending at that sphere. Which side of the road the target stands
 * on is a fact about those two points rather than a sign somebody has to get
 * right.
 *
 * **Both heights come off the ground under the *foot*, and that is a decision
 * rather than an oversight.** `base.y` is `buildPlan`'s `fieldHeightAt` there —
 * the finished heightfield, said out loud, because M12's two placement defect
 * classes were both a subsystem meaning the other of the two surfaces this
 * project calls "the ground" (AGENTS.md, "two subsystems place things at the
 * ground"). `centre.y` is then that height plus the strike height, so the stand
 * is one rigid object: a post of a known length with a pad on the end of it.
 *
 * The alternative — resolving the disc against the road it hangs over and the
 * foot against the verge it stands on — is more faithful to a crowned road and
 * makes the stand a *different shape* at every station, which costs the render
 * budget the whole reason a target family is affordable. One rigid shape is one
 * `InstancedMesh` and two draw calls; a per-station shape is a merged mesh
 * rebuilt whenever anything moves. What makes the rigid version honest is a
 * placement contract rather than an assumption: `placeTargets` refuses a stand
 * whose foot is more than a kerb's height off the road beside it, so the pad is
