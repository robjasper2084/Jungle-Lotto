 * what lets the controller be driven identically by a keyboard, by a gamepad
 * at M9, and by the QA bridge in a Playwright spec, with no branch anywhere
 * saying which one is talking.
 *
 * No DOM here on purpose: `keyboard.ts` owns the events, this file owns the
 * meaning, and the meaning is unit-testable with a fake clock.
 *
 * Values are raw. Smoothing belongs to the controller at M2 — lean is a state
 * variable driven toward the input target, so a pre-smoothed input would be
 * smoothing a smoothed thing and the two time constants would fight.

 * meanings that remain separately observable". The Hop control keeps its
 * pressed/buffered `hop` exactly; the *level* of the same control is a second,
 * independent reading of it. Being a `HeldAction` is what buys the two
 * properties the plan needs and nothing else in this file has to be taught:
 * the per-device `Set<InputDevice>` makes it the OR of the devices rather than
 * a Boolean two of them fight over, and every reset in the input contract
 * (`clearDevice`, `clearDevices`, `clearAll`) already drops it with no new call
 * site to forget.
 *
 * It is **not** a `BINDINGS` row. The settings screen offers one Hop row, and
 * each device layer derives the level from whatever that row resolved to — a
 * player who rebinds Hop to J moves both meanings with it.
